OS X Lion doesn't ship with smbpasswd any more, which means you can't change your windows domain password from the command line. 
This script looks for smbpasswd locally (just in case some of your users aren't running Lion) and if doesn't find it it connects 
to a remote linux box where you can use it's smbpasswd with minimal hassle for the OS X user. 
I don't expect this to be useful for everybody, it doesn't fix the problem it just tries to circumvent it and make it less painful for the end user.

Things to look for in the script to adapt it to your own network: the ip addresses, 192.168.0.1 should reflect your DC and 192.168.1.200 your linux box
that you can leverage in case smbpasswd isn't available locally. mind the username when the system tries to connect to the linux via SSH as well.

I strongly recommend that you lock down the user account that will connect to that linux box, make sure they can only run smbpasswd.
